Hello I'm Aaron.

I'm a college student from Switzerland.

In my free time I like to program. I also help out on the Microsoft [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys) project. There I label issues and search for duplicates.

In this blog I'm writing about things I want to. Most of the time about programming or other IT things.

Programming languages I can program in:
* C#
* PHP
* Javascript
* Python

Markup languages:
* HTML
* XAML

Programming Languages I could program in the past:
* Minecraft Commands
* Minecraft plugins with Java

I'm generally very interested in computers in all ways. (More software then hardware.)
