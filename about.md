### General information

Hello I'm Noraa.

I'm a computer science student from Switzerland.

In my free time I like to program and to try out new things on computers. I contribute to various [open source repositories of Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/) and help them triaging issues. 

I'm generally enamored with all things computers. (More software than hardware.)

In this blog I'm writing about things I want to do and most of the time that has to do with programming or other IT related things.
