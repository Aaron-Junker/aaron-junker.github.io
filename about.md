### General information

Hello I'm Aaron.

I'm a student from Switzerland.

In my free time I like to program and to try out new things on computers. I also help triaging different [repositories of Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/). There I label issues and search for duplicates.

I'm generally enamored with all things computers. (More software than hardware.)

In this blog I'm writing about things I want to do and most of the time that has to do with programming or other IT related things.

You can find more information about my projects on the [projects page](/projects/).
