Hello I'm Aaron.

I'm a college student from Switzerland.

In my free time I like to program. I also help out on the Microsoft [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys) project. There I label issues and search for duplicates.

In this blog I'm writing about things I want to do and most of the time that has to do with programming or other IT related things.

Programming languages I can program with:
* PHP (PRO)
* Javascript
* Python
* a bit of C#
* Minecraft Commands

Markup languages:
* HTML
* A bit of XAML

Programming Languages I've programmed with in the past:
* Java: Created awesome Minecraft plugins!

My biggest project currently is my CMS [USOC](https://github.com/case-games/USOC).

I also own a ECDL/ICDL base [certificate](https://member.sophiatesting.com/data/pdffiles/d2581f6771d13239b99fa478930cff9d.pdf?cache=1610264602499).

I'm generally enamored with all things computers. (More software than hardware.)
