## About me

Hello I'm Aaron.

I'm a college student from Switzerland.

In my free time I like to program. I also help out on the Microsoft [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys) project. There I label issues and search for duplicates.

In this blog I'm writing about things I want to. Most of the time about programming or other IT things.

Programming languages I can programm:
* PHP (very good)
* Javascript
* Python
* a bit C#
* Minecraft Commands

Markup languages:
* HTML
* A bit XAML

Programming Languages I could program in the past:
* Minecraft plugins with Java

My biggest Project currently is my CMS [USOC](https://github.com/case-games/USOC).

I also own a ECDL/ICDL base certificate. (https://member.sophiatesting.com/data/pdffiles/d2581f6771d13239b99fa478930cff9d.pdf?cache=1610264602499)

I'm generally very interested in computers in all ways. (More software then hardware.)
