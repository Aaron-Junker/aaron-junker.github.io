# Introduction 

As a web developer it's sometimes very difficult to keep an overview of all browser engines out there an what you have to pay attention for.

In this article I talk always about the newest version of the engines (on 21. November 2021).

The blink engine powers the different chromium browsers and is the most spread browser engine.

To the chromium browsers count among other ones:

* Of course [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/edge)
