Tired of searching where you put this one file? I will show you 3 tips how you can keep your files organised.

# 1. Use the libraries feature of Windows 10

In Windows 10 there are some built-in libraries like images, documents, videos, etc. Use them! 

But don't just put all your documents in to the documents folder. You should make subfolders to organize the files.

You can also create your own libraries. Just rightclick on a folder -> Add to library -> New library.

# 2. Icons

# 3. Hide

# (4.) No desktop
