Hello world! And welcome to my new developer blog.
Here I will write how my life as a developer is going forward and about personal thought on IT topics.

This blog is inspired by other developers who also make something like I do here.

My goal is to write every month at least 2 articles.

It's not my first blog. So I have some experience.

I'm curious how this will go on.
