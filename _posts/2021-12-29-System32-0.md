## Introduction to the System32 Discovery series

Welcome to this new blog/video series, where we will cover all the applications/dll's and other stuff inside the system32 folder of Windows.

There will be no special order of the items we will cove. I hope I can with this series help people to discover sides of Windows they never knew existed.
