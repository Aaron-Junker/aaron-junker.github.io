First of all, I want to say: That's my personal point of view. I could be wrong with some things I'm saying in this article.

## What exactly is the Feedback Hub?

The Feedback Hub is an App for Windows 10. It's for giving Microsoft Feedback and collect bug reports. But that don't work as it should.

## Why is that not working?

On my point of view there are these ... points:

### Microsoft lost the overview

In the feedback app there are too many duplicates and too many new suggestions and bug reports and as far as I can see Microsoft doesn't have enough employees to get all these watched.

### You need a Microsoft Account

If you want to use the Feedback Hub you must have a Microsoft Account. That's dumb, because not every windows user has a Microsoft Account. For example for login into the Microsoft Security Research Center you can also use your Google account.

### You can only access the Feedback Hub with the App

There is no web interface or apps for other devices.

### You can give Feedback to not Microsoft related products

You can give Feedback to every app you have on your computer. Then it's clear that gives some chaos.

### The App is slow

The search and loading comments is sometimes very slow. 

### You don't really get something for the Quests

No Points. No Award. Nothing.

## How could Microsoft repair there fault?

In my opinion Microsoft should:

*   Add more employees
*   Delete every feedback that's under 50 up votes
*   Delete every bug report from non Microsoft applications
*   Create bots to link to the bug report pages of other products (Like PowerToys collects there bugs on GitHub)
*   Create a better quest system
