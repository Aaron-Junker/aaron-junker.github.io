In this article I will present you some of the applications I use to programm. Let's begin!

## Visual Studio Code
You can find more information about why I'm using VS Code in the [blogaticle about why I switched to VS Code](https://noraajunker.ch/Why-I-switched-to-Visual-Studio-code/).

## XAMPP
XAMPP is the perfect web server for Windows. It's using Apache and MySQL. Problems are very uncommen. And if a new PHP version releases is a new XAMPP release not far away. That's why I'm using it.

## FileZilla
To connect to a FTP server, FileZilla is the perfect solution. It's easy to use and very common updated. The only dumb thing is, it forgets some things after an update.

## PuTTY

As SSH client for windows is PuTTY perfect for me. I can't say very much to it. PuTTY also has some other dunctionalitys, but I don't use them.

## WinMerge

This tool is very unknown, but very useful. It acts like the `diff` command in linux. But it has a very good interface and menu structure.
