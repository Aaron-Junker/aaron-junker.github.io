Tired of searching where you put this one file? I will show you 3 tips how you can keep your files organised.

# 1. Use the libraries feature of Windows 10

In Windows 10 there are some built-in libraries like images, documents, videos, etc. Use them! 

But don't just put all your documents in to the documents folder. You should make subfolders to organize the files.

You can also create your own libraries. Just rightclick on a folder -> Add to library -> New library.

# 2. Icons for the folders

You can set costum icons for your folders inside of your libraries. This helps keeping the overview.

You can change the icon by right clicking on the folder -> Properties -> Costumize -> Change icon. You can choose between many built-in icons or your own ico files.

# 3. Hide folders from applications

Many applications create folders in documents for saving data. It's obvious that you can't just delete them. But you can hide them.

1. Select all the files and folders you don't need.
2. Click on "view" in the menubar of the Explorer
3. Click "Hide selected files"
4. Select "Make changes only on this folder"

Of course you need to deactivate the view of hidden folders.

# (4.) No files/folders on the desktop

And something little for the end: Don't put your files and folders on to the desktop. That would just create a mess. But shortcuts are okay!
