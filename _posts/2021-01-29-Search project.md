My current main developer project is USOC. Soon the 1.0 version will be released. This doesn't mean I want let USOC die. But I just want another main project.

So I will work on something different on a terrain I never was before, but I can't say it here now. It's a secret! ;-) And this also is forever.

So, I have 3 things I could do:

### A game

I've started making a game 1 1/2 years ago, but most of the project got lost, because my hard drive had some errors. I would make it in Unity. But i'm not sure if my PC is really strong enough for a beautiful game. I could make a pixel game. But I don't know.

### Status page

There are many status page systems (for example: [https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage/)](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage/)) But there are all not open source or for free or they just don't look good. I want something like this for hosting by yourself

### Application

Maybe it's time to program just a application with visual C# or something like this. I don't really did this before. But I have no idea what I should do.

We will see. I hope I can decide soon. If you have any idea just contact me on twitter.
