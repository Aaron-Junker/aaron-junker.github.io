2 Months ago I switched from [Atom](https://atom.io) to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
I did this because:

* The Git functionalty stopped working without a reason
* I wanted something new
* VS Code has more extensions
* VS Code has a better autocompletion

I don't regret this decision and i'm very happy with VS Code.

I'm  sorry that this post isn't that long.
