It's been a while since the last blog post, but I'm back!

Did you notice it? The new laptops/computers/iMacs/etc from Microsoft and Apple got more colorful.

<small>The new Surface Laptop 4 also comes in 4 special colors (Personally I love the black one) (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08YWQJ5XS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08YWQJ5XS&linkCode=as2&tag=roundcheckbox-20&linkId=9b518879f99c42417a823ea3b7baf3e8">Microsoft Surface Laptop 4*</a>)

The computers of the last 10 years all had grey or black color.

<small>This HP notebook has the same color scheme like all the computers from the past 10 years(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08529BZSQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08529BZSQ&linkCode=as2&tag=roundcheckbox-20&linkId=a059347afdf2fb46b3e1050ac5e5b7c2">HP Chromebook 14-inch HD Laptop*</a>)</small>

Why? That's simple! The people have enough of this grey world. Specially after/in this pandemic people want something new, something that looks fancy and cool. They want more color in their life. And this is the start of it.

Retro was a long time a trend, but I think now that changes to colorful.

Recently, I looked at my socks drawer and thought: "I want more colorful socks not only black ones".

I predict that "colorful" gets the new trend.

And I personally love that! It always looks good when something is available in different colors.
