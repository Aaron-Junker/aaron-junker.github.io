You maybe heard something of operator priority before, that means for example that `1+2*3` results in `7` and not `9` (You always calculate first `*` and `/` and after that `+` and `-`).
So in PHP the order of AND and OR statements is:

1. &&
2. ||
3. AND
4. XOR
5. OR

Example:

```php
<?php
    // That's the same as $a||($b&&$C)
    $a || $b && $C;
    // That's the same as ($a||$b)&&$C
    $a || $b AND $C;
?>
```

`AND`, `XOR` and `OR` are the lowest operators in PHP. So, all other operators are executed first.
