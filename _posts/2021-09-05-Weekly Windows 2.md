## Windows 11 release date got announced

Microsoft announced in a [blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/) that Windows 11 will be available October 5th. It will be a staged release, so not everyone will receive the final build on this day.

They also released a short video which shows how good gaming works on Windows 11:
