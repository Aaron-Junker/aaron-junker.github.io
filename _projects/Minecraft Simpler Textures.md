## Overview

This texture pack is a texture pack for the game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) with very low detailed textures. It is currently discontinued.

## What this project means to me

I started this project at a young age, because I wanted to create a new texture pack for Minecraft. It was also my start in editing pixel images and in using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org).
