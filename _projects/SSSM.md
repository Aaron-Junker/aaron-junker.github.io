## Project overview

This is a state machine for PHP. You can find the package on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/aaronjunker/sssm).

## What does this project mean to me

This project is the first one I published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org). It was the first time I wrote a package, that I made publicly available.
