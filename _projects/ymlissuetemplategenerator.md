## Project overview

This is a generator for the new yml issue templates. You can find the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Noraa-Junker/ymlissueteplategenerator). 

## What does this project mean to me

It's a small project I did to learn more about the new yml issue templates. It was also an opportunity for me to make a project and finish it, because I had the feeling I never finish any projects.
