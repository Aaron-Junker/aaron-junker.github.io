## Overview

This preview handler which is part of the [File Explorer add-ons](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/file-explorer) of [Microsoft PowerToys](Microsoft PowerToys) allows you to view certain programming files (like .py, .cs, .xml, etc.) in the preview pane of the File Explorer.

## What this project means to me

This project was my first big programming project. It allowed me to work with the PowerToys team. It was alot of effort to get the WebView used to work in the preview pane, but it was worth it. I learned a lot about programming and about the Windows API.
