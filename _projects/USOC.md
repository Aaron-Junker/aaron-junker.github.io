## Project overview

This is a CMS written in PHP. It's currently in an alpha status.

## What does this project mean to me

It's a place for me to try new things out with PHP. It's like a playground for new learned web techniques and PHP tricks. It's never intended to be a big CMS used by many people. Just something to test my PHP skills.

But currently I stopped working on it for time reasons.
